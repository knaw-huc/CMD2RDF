                "eng": "Description of the \"Lamp\" experiment Children were asked to carry out two tasks: 1. To watch a short clip on a laptop, which shows lamps being switched on and off in a particular temporal constellation (see stimuli) 2. After watching the clip, childern had to act-out the clip by using real lamps standing on a table in front of them. 3. The last task was to verbalize the temporal constellation in the movie shown to them. The order of tasks number (2) and (3) were counterbalanced. That is, half of the children acted-out before they retold the stimulus and half of the children first verbalized the content of the clip and then acted-out. In all cases, children were watching the stimulus together with the chief investigator and acted-out and retold it to an assistant who was also present in the room. The assistant, however, did not watch the stimulus. The child was asked to inform the assistant about the content of the clip so that she could imagine what it was about. In this manner, the child was motivated to be as specific as possible. "
