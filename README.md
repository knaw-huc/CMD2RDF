CMD2RDF
=======

CMD2RDF is a CLARIN-NL project to make the CMD record harvested by
CLARIN available as RDF.

## Getting started

### Configure the app
The main configuration file is located at:
* /path/to/CMD2RDF/batch/src/main/resources/cmd2rdf.xml

### Running the batch process
This guide expects that the code is already built.

1. Make sure your RDF store is running (e.g., GraphDB or Virtuoso).

2. Run the batch module to convert CMDI records to RDF.
